# SI Units Are NOT a Panacea

I hear the refrain all the time about how silly Americans are for using Imperial
units for everything. Honestly, most often I hear this from Americans themselves,
right before they sell me a 12oz cup of coffee.

And to some extent they're correct. Certainly there's no arguing that there being
5280 feet in a mile is, at best, an arbitrary and difficult to remember conversion
which you can't practically do in your head. However acknowledging the failings of
the **conversions** between certain Imperial units does not automatically
mean that SI units are objectively superior for some reason. And what you're
really arguing at that point is that the "Metric System" is nice. And to be clear,
I dont disagree, the **METRIC system** is great. Divide by 1000, add a "kilo"?
Sign me up. What I take issue with are the units themselves.

The Metric System and SI units are **not** the same thing! And that's not just
a technical point. Is "Celcius" a "metric" unit? There's no kilo-celci-i! No,
Celsius just happens to be the SI unit for temperature, but it just as easily
could have been Kelvin, Fahrenheit, or something else.

There's no reason you couldn't apply the/a metric system to imperial units. kilofeet,
milliounces, and such. Granted, those particular units may or may not make practical
**base units** for such a system, but that's not to say that that it's not possible.

Essentially, what i'm trying to get across is that the fundamental unit you use
for any particular measurement ought to be optimized for general day-to-day convenience.

## Temperature

If we're all being honest with ourselves, Celsius is not a very ergonomic unit.

"Oh but its based off the freezing and boiling temperature of water! So useful!
Fahrenheit is so stupid, 32 and 212 degrees? Come on!"

Okay, fine. But where in life to **you** actually care about the boiling and
freezing temperatures of water? And when you do, do you **really** need thermometer
to tell you what the temperature is? Exactly, no you don't. When the temperature
(of water) is close to 0C...you get ice. When it's close to 100C...you have boiling
water. It's self evident. If we're not talking about water, then your specific
choice of scale was pretty arbitrary now, wasnt it? You really get zero practical
use from Celsius' supposed primary benefit.

Now let's talk about Fahrenheit for a second. 0F is randomly the freezing temperature
of some brine and 100F is based on a not particularly great estimate of a human's
body temperature (98.6F oof. Although i'd say that's pretty close for the time).
However those seemingly stupid bases actually **do** lead to some practical benefits.

I wont argue that the basis for 0F was a particularly good choice...necessarily.
However I will say that 0F is a pretty typical weather temperature. It's **convenient**
that most of the time when you're talking about the temperature outside, you have
positive Fahrenheit temperature. 0C on the other hand, is pretty warm by comparison.
When describing outside temperature, Celsius users must have to frequently dip
into negative values.

100F (or rather 98.6F) is where it gets a little bit more practical. Being based
on human body temperature might sound stupid, but essentially what you get from that
is a scale which is more well tuned to human perception of temperature itself.
0F is a cold, but humanly livable temperatuve. 100F is a hot, but humanly livable
temperature. Both are temperatures which are useful day-to-day because weather
temperatures regularly approach those temperatures depending on where you live.
Celsius, by contrast, is much less practical! 38C is 100F... The whole range
of celcius temperatures from, say, 50C to 100C is basically irrelevant.

And the consequence of having such a low practical number range is that all the values
are compressed. You have less than half the level granularity with Celsius as
you do with Fahrenheit. Humans can perceive 1F differences in temperature in a room (
going back to Fahrenheit being based off human body temperatures). Thus a Fahrenheit
thermostat only needs to deal in whole numbers. With the Celcius scale, it's
inadequate to describe temperatures in whole numbers, but at the same time you
likely can't detect the difference between 30.1C and 30.2C.

A quick shoutout to anyone who might want to bring up Kelvin. Meh. Scientists
have an entirely different domain of what is considered "practical". They should
have their own scale and they can do conversions if they need/want to.

So to conclude the discussion on the temperature: Fahrenheit is not perfect! Perhaps
it should have a somewhat lower bound, or otherwise be slightly adjusted to be
more optimal. 212 is awwwwfully close to 200. Maybe you shift the scale down by 12,
and have 0F, 10F (freezing water), 100F, and 200F (boiling water) for nice round
numbers. But otherwise I think it's much more practical than Celcius.
