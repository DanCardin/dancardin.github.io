Annotation inference details \u0026ldquo;invoke\u0026rdquo; (click-like) details Cappa is a declarative command line parsing library, taking much of its inspiration from the \u0026ldquo;Derive\u0026rdquo; API from the Clap written in Rust.\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field import cappa from typing import Literal from typing_extensions import Annotated @dataclass class Example: positional_arg: str = \u0026#34;optional\u0026#34; boolean_flag: bool = False single_option: Annotated[int | None, cappa.Arg(short=True, help=\u0026#34;A number\u0026#34;)] = None multiple_option: Annotated[ list[Literal[\u0026#34;one\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;two\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;three\u0026#34;]], cappa.Arg(long=True, help=\u0026#34;Pick one!\u0026#34;), ] = field(default_factory=list) args: Example = cappa.parse(Example, backend=cappa.backend) print(args) Produces the following CLI:\nIn this way, you can turn any dataclass-like object (with some additional annotations, depending on what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for) into a CLI.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll note that cappa.parse returns an instance of the class. This API should feel very familiar to argparse, except that you get the fully typed dataclass instance back instead of a raw Namespace.\nInvoke \u0026ldquo;invoke\u0026rdquo; documentation\nThe \u0026ldquo;invoke\u0026rdquo; API is meant to feel more like the experience you get when using click or typer. You can take the same dataclass, but register a function to be called on successful parsing of the command.\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass import cappa from typing_extensions import Annotated def function(example: Example): print(example) @cappa.command(invoke=function) class Example: # identical to original class positional_arg: str boolean_flag: bool single_option: Annotated[int | None, cappa.Arg(long=True)] multiple_option: Annotated[list[str], cappa.Arg(short=True)] cappa.invoke(Example) (Note the lack of the dataclass decorator. You can optionally omit or include it, and it will be automatically inferred).\nAlternatively you can make your dataclass callable, as a shorthand for an explicit invoke function:\n@dataclass class Example: ... # identical to original class def __call__(self): print(self) Note invoke=function can either be a reference to some callable, or a string module-reference to a function (which will get lazily imported and invoked).\nWith a single top-level command, the click-like API isn\u0026rsquo;t particularly valuable by comparison. Click\u0026rsquo;s command-centric API is primarily useful when composing a number of nested subcommands.\nSubcommands The useful aspect of click\u0026rsquo;s functional composability is that you can define some number of subcommands functions under a parent command, whichever subcommand the function targets will be invoked.\nimport click @click.group(\u0026#39;example\u0026#39;) def example(): ... @example.command(\u0026#34;print\u0026#34;) @click.option(\u0026#39;--loudly\u0026#39;, is_flag=True) def print_cmd(loudly): if loudly: print(\u0026#34;PRINTING!\u0026#34;) else: print(\u0026#34;printing!\u0026#34;) @example.command(\u0026#34;fail\u0026#34;) @click.option(\u0026#39;--code\u0026#39;, type: int) def fail_cmd(code): raise click.Exit(code=code) # Called like: # /example.py print # /example.py fail Whereas with argparse, you\u0026rsquo;d have had to manually match and call the functions yourself. This API does all of the hard parts of deciding which function to call.\nSimilarly, you can achieve the same thing with cappa.\nfrom __future__ import annotations from dataclasses import dataclass import cappa @dataclass class Example: cmd: cappa.Subcommands[Print | Fail] def print_cmd(print: Print): if print.loudly: print(\u0026#34;PRINTING!\u0026#34;) else: print(\u0026#34;printing!\u0026#34;) @cappa.command(invoke=print_cmd) class Print: loudly: bool @dataclass class Fail: code: int def __call__(self): # again, __call__ is shorthand for the above explicit `invoke=` form. raise cappa.Exit(code=code) cappa.invoke(Example) Function-based Commands Purely functions-based can only be used for certain kinds of CLI interfaces. However, they can reduce the ceremony required to define a given CLI command.\nimport cappa from typing_extensions import Annotated def function(foo: int, bar: bool, option: Annotated[str, cappa.Arg(long=True)] = \u0026#34;opt\u0026#34;): ... cappa.invoke(function) Such a CLI is exactly equivalent to a CLI defined as a dataclass with the function\u0026rsquo;s arguments as the dataclass\u0026rsquo;s fields.\nThere are various downsides to using functions. Given that there is no class to reference, any feature which relies on being able to name the type will be impossible to use. For example, subcommands cannot be naturally defined as functions (since there is no type with which to reference the subcommand).\n","permalink":"https://dancardin.github.io/projects/cappa/","summary":"Cappa Full documentation here.

It\u0026rsquo;s mutating the list, putting the contents of the right hand list into the left hand one.\nSlice assignment is a little used feature, probably likely because python does a pretty bad job of documenting a bunch of its syntactical features. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any PEPs referencing slice assignment, and there aren\u0026rsquo;t any obvious references in the docs either. If you search for \u0026ldquo;slice assignment\u0026rdquo;, you definitely get a bunch of results, just not from python itself.\nIt turns out that python lacks list methods or other options for efficiently altering lists beyond appending. You get [].append, and [].extend. Then you get [].insert, but no corresponding equivalent to extend. Alternatively, you could just live with unpacking or adding the two lists together and allocating a new one.\nBut it gets pretty funny.

The difference is in how index lookups are performed. In str.format(), index values that do not look like numbers are converted to strings\nEssentially it boils down to the fact that fstrings take advantage of python\u0026rsquo;s actual parser, and therefore have syntax consistent with the rest of the language, whereas str.format is approximating regular python syntax by reimplementing some common access patterns in a mini lookalike-dsl.\nAnd indeed if you attempt the same thing with an fstring:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; f\u0026#39;{a[\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;b\u0026#34;]}\u0026#39; *** \u0026#39;4\u0026#39; While some people may look at that and find the behavior unsurprising, I personally think it looks like an unfortunate footgun that one would be forgiven to think had different semantics than it has.\nI can see what they were probably thinking at the time:\nThere\u0026rsquo;s going to be some additional complexity in parsing the extra syntax to support a[\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;] What would a[b] even mean? Presumably b would have to be some additional str.format argument? (It gets a bit weird because it\u0026rsquo;s not capturing local variables like fstrings do). Given the above, why force the user to type quotes all the time? My hot take is that it\u0026rsquo;s fine for str.format to not attempt to support arbitrary python syntax, but that what it does support should have identical semantics. I.e. I should be able to copy that portion of the format string out of the string and it should behave the same.\n","permalink":"https://dancardin.github.io/wats/python-formatting/","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"n\"\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e=\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e{\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e{\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u0026#39;b\u0026#39;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"mi\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e}}\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u0026#39;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"si\"\u003e{a[\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;b\u0026#34;]}\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u0026#39;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"n\"\u003eformat\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"n\"\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e=\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"n\"\u003easdf\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e***\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"ne\"\u003eKeyError\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u0026#39;\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u0026#39;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"si\"\u003e{a[a][b]}\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u0026#39;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"n\"\u003eformat\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"n\"\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"o\"\u003e=\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"n\"\u003easdf\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"p\"\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"line\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"cl\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u0026#39;4\u0026#39;\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","title":"Python Formatting"},{"content":"[1,2,3,4,].length // 4 [1,2,3,4,,].length // 5 27.toString() // Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token 27..toString() // \u0026#39;27\u0026#39; Wat.\nIn the former example, [1,2,3,4,,], I simply dont understand the rationale.
